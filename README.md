# dotfiles

These are all my dotfiles. Most of these work across my macOS work computer, as well as my home computers running Fedora Linux.

Automatic installation of these configuration files is possible with [Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

To install the Linux focused files run:

```console
./install --linux
```

To install the macOS files: 

```console
./install --macos
```
